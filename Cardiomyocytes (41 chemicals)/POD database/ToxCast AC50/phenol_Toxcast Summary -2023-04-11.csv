NVS_NR_hER,"Data from the assay component NVS_NR_hER was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint. This assay endpoint, NVS_NR_hER, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. 
Using a type of binding reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the binding as they relate to the gene ESR1. 
Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because the performed assay has only produced 1 assay endpoint. 
To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the ""nuclear receptor"" intended target family, where the subfamily is ""steroidal"".",NP_000116.2,ESR1,estrogen receptor 1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099,"[200,29,165,53,52,30,67,112,167,200,29,165,53,52,167,112,30,67]",[1181],Active,39.5530859132757,1.6214517189201012,0.11232917081658013,-0.949507446948183,4.06560424132541,39.4456828213342,percent_activity,-0.221848749616356,24.3936254479525,"[""Less than 50% efficacy"",""Hit-call potentially confounded by overfitting"",""Less than 50% efficacy"",""Hit-call potentially confounded by overfitting""]",-0.894248169551779,-1.04334206815984,-1.20474771160379,20,nuclear receptor
