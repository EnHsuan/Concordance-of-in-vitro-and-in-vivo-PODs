CCTE_Deisenroth_AIME_384WELL_LUC_Inactive_up,"CCTE_Deisenroth_AIME_384WELL_LUC_Inactive_up is a component of the CCTE_Deisenroth_AIME_384WELL assay that measures the effect of retroftting the VM7Luc ERTA assay with the Alginate Immobolization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) metabolism method. AIME is optimized to impart phase I hepatic metabolism using phenobarbital/beta-naphthoflavone induced hepatic S9 from male Sprague Dawley rats. Parent chemicals are incubated for 2 hours in the AIME assay prior to transfer to the VM7Luc ERTA assay plate. The AIME metabolism assay is run simultaneously in negative (inactive) and positive (active) modes to evaluate the activity of parent and metabolites, respectively. This endpoint evaluates reporter induction in metabolism negative mode.

CCTE_Deisenroth_AIME_384WELL_LUC_Shift_dn,"CCTE_Deisenroth_AIME_384WELL_LUC_Shift_up is a component of the CCTE_Deisenroth_AIME_384WELL assay that measures the effect of retroftting the VM7Luc ERTA assay with the Alginate Immobolization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) metabolism method. AIME is optimized to impart phase I hepatic metabolism using phenobarbital/beta-naphthoflavone induced hepatic S9 from male Sprague Dawley rats. Parent chemicals are incubated for 2 hours in the AIME assay prior to transfer to the VM7Luc ERTA assay plate. The AIME metabolism assay is run simultaneously in negative (inactive) and positive (active) modes to evaluate the activity of parent and metabolites, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This endpoint evaluates the shift in metabolism-dependent changes between positive (active) and negative (inactive) assay modes. The metabolic curve shift response is defined as the pairwise difference between the positive (AEID 2488) and negative (AEID 2490) normalized response values at each concentration for a given chemical across replicate experiments. The pairwise differences form the basis for a concentration-response curve. Standard curve fit analysis identfiied chemicals where the calculated shift was greater than the shift-derived baseline cutoff. A positive hit designation in this endpoint indicates a significant shift trend in the negative direction for bioinactivation.
