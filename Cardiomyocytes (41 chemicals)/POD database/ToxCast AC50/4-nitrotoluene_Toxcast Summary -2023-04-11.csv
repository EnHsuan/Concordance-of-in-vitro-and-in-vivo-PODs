ATG_PXRE_CIS_up,"Data from the assay component ATG_PXRE_CIS was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint. 
This assay endpoint, ATG_PXRE_CIS_up, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. 
Using a type of inducible reporter, measures of mRNA for gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand the reporter gene at the transcription factor-level as they relate to the gene NR1I2. 
Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a reporter gene function.
