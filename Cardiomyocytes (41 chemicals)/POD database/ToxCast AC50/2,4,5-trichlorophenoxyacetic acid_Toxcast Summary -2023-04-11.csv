This assay endpoint, TOX21_RXR_BLA_Agonist_ch2, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. Using a type of inducible reporter, increased activity can be used to understand changes in the reporter gene as they relate to the gene RXRA.

Using a type of inducible reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the reporter gene as they relate to the gene THRA and THRB. Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because the performed assay has only produced 1 assay endpoint. To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the nuclear receptor intended target family, where the subfamily is non-steroidal.","NP_003241.2|NP_000452.2","THRA | THRB","thyroid hormone receptor, alpha , thyroid hormone receptor, beta","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7067 , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7068",,,Active,64.4451303852512,2.872303316313185,65.42702100494412,1.81575714663846,3.73945711206963,48.91498629,percent_activity,1.95424250943932,22.4367426724178,"[""Only highest conc above baseline, active"",""Less than 50% efficacy"",""Only highest conc above baseline, active"",""Less than 50% efficacy""]",1.74203133232771,1.63272569953834,1.55746620797352,20,nuclear receptor
