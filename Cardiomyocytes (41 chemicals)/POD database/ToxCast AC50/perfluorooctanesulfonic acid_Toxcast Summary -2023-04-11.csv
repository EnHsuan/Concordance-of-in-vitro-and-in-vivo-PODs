NVS_ADME_hCYP19A1,"Data from the assay component NVS_ADME_hCYP19A1 was analyzed into 2 assay endpoints. This assay endpoint, NVS_ADME_hCYP19A1, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to Acetonitrile as the negative control and baseline of activity. 
Using a type of enzyme reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the enzymatic activity as they relate to the gene CYP19A1. 
Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a enzymatic activity function.

To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the cell cycle intended target family, where the subfamily is cytotoxicity.",, , , ,,,Active,41.2237979754875,1.5161385108028431,37.25523146242683,1.57118726596317,4.53166577259249,37.78056660685,percent_activity,1.90308998699194,27.1899946355549,"[""Less than 50% efficacy"",""Less than 50% efficacy""]",1.65262054696459,1.48387141311544,1.30065115271771,20,cell cycle
