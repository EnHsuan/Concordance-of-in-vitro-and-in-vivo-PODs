CCTE_GLTED_hTTR_dn,"Data from the assay component CCTE_GLTED_hTTR was analyzed at the assay endpoint CCTE_GLTED_hTTR_dn in the positive analysis fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. Using a type of binding reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand a chemical's ability to displace T4 from transthyretin. To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the 'transporter' intended target family, where  the subfamily is 'hormone carrier protein'.",, , , ,,,Active,100.46674328716475,5.023337164358237,0.7237371150821266,-0.1404191550759675,2.991935744486705,98.4042553191489,percent_activity,2.30102999566398,20,,-1.1413757147418,-1.809773624726253,-1.7202682116482046,30,transporter

NVS_GPCR_gLTB4,"Data from the assay component NVS_GPCR_gLTB4 was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint. This assay endpoint, NVS_GPCR_gLTB4, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. 
Using a type of binding reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the binding as they relate to the gene Ltb4r. 
Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because the performed assay has only produced 1 assay endpoint. 
To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the ""gpcr"" intended target family, where the subfamily is ""rhodopsin-like receptor"".",NP_001166306.1,Ltb4r,leukotriene B4 receptor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/100379538,,,Active,99.7168774001243,3.349613606852939,14.048081003396486,1.14761700277805,4.96161095497277,83.0973978679732,percent_activity,1.69897000433602,29.7696657298366,,0.748057333316625,0.333610343339284,0.119906837002806,21,gpcr
