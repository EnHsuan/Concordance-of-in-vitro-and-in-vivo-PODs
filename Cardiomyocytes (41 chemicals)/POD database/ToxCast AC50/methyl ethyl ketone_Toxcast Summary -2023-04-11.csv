ATG_HIF1a_CIS_up,"Data from the assay component ATG_HIF1a_CIS was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint. 
This assay endpoint, ATG_HIF1a_CIS_up, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. 
Using a type of inducible reporter, measures of mRNA for gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand the reporter gene at the transcription factor-level as they relate to the gene HIF1A. 
Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a reporter gene function. 
To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the dna binding intended target family, where the subfamily is basic helix-loop-helix protein.",NP_001521.1,HIF1A,"hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3091,"[122,123,220,150,122,123,220,150]",[801],Active,0.920338912,1.202293546,163.6746492,2.213981419,0.153097206,0.766949097,log2_fold_induction,2.301029996,0.765486029,"[""Borderline active"",""Only one conc above baseline, active"",""Hit-call potentially confounded by overfitting""]",2.300733666,2.213774299,2.094701105,20.10000038,dna binding
NVS_ENZ_hMMP9,"Data from the assay component NVS_ENZ_hMMP9 was analyzed into 2 assay endpoints. This assay endpoint, NVS_ENZ_hMMP9, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. 
Using a type of enzyme reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the enzymatic activity as they relate to the gene MMP9. 
Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a enzymatic activity function.
