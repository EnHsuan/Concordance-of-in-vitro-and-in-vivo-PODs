ACEA_AR_agonist_80hr,"Data from the assay component ACEA_AR_agonist_80hr was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. 
Using a type of growth reporter, measures of the cells for gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand the signaling at the pathway-level as they relate to the geneAR 
Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a signaling function. 
To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the ""nuclear receptor"" intended target family, where the subfamily is ""steroidal"".",,AR,androgen receptor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367,,,Active,86.3582176584589,3.8155734889222854,59.09726267980789,1.7715673653045,7.54436328808604,58.9422284568017,percent_activity,2,22.6330898642581,,0.826122017384304,0.826122017384304,-0.235217847263543,20,nuclear receptor
