This assay endpoint, TOX21_TR_LUC_GH3_Antagonist, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. Using a type of inducible reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the reporter gene as they relate to the gene THRA and THRB. Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because the performed assay has only produced 1 assay endpoint.
