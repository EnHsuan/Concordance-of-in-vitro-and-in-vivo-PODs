## Six-cell-type (15 chemicals)
  ### See details in README in "Six-cell-type (15 chemicals)" repository
  - POD database
    1) Convert oral in vivo PODs to steady state concentrations
    2) Generate Bayesian model averaging benchmark dose plots and compare with regulatory PODs
  - Input script:
    1) Analyze the most sensitive cell types from iPSC-Neurons, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-hepatocytes, iPSC-endothelial cell, iPSC-cardiomyocyte, human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC), and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs)
    2) Correlation analysis of in vitro and in vivo PODs
    3) Meta-analysis of log10(in vitro POD/in vivo POD)
