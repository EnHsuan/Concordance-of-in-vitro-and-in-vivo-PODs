To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the dna binding intended target family, where subfamily is NF-kappa B.",NP_002948.1, , , ,,,Active,46.1302711833793,2.306513559168965,28.63241735855255,1.4568580158931,2.27839049691729,45.118951169,percent_activity,1.90308998699194,20,"[""Less than 50% efficacy"",""Less than 50% efficacy""]",1.42962742453415,1.27872212242544,1.23307272338257,20,dna binding
